# ðŸŽ´ Poker Hand Classification with Decision Trees

This project implements a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict poker hands from a dataset of playing cards.  
The main goals are:
- Preprocess categorical features (cards & suits) using **One-Hot Encoding**  
- Train a **Decision Tree model** with scikit-learn  
- Evaluate performance with different metrics  
- Visualize the decision tree for better interpretability
